# Evaluating-Positional-Analog-Scanning-as-a-Method-for-Lead-Optimization
Screening the ChEMBL database to find analog pairs that have been tested in the same assay. This allows us to explore the increments in binding affinity by adding functional groups to a molecule, while comparing them to other substituents. This will prioritize molecules for experimental testing and lead optimization.
